# About the Yapper Slack Bot

The reason I started developing Yapper was due to my personal channel (a channel made and managed by you) in the Hack Club Slack being kind of dead. I was inspired by another Hack Clubbers bot names Zeon that tracks everything from Crypto transactions to daily logs. It was basically their own companion bot that made the server more alive.

I wanted my bot to have 1 main function: Track literally everything I do and display to everyone in my slack channel. A little invasive? Yes. But also very hilarious
