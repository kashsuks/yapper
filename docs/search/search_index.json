Latest Node.js version npm Package Manager Slack Account, Workspace, and the necessary permissions to create bots Git or Github Desktop Installation In order to install the Yapper Slack bot, you must git clone it through the following command: git clone https://github.com/kashsuks/yapper Now we need to install all the dependencies in order to have the files for the API's and trackers working npm install In order to test and check whether or not your installation has issues, run: node index.js If the node setup works, then there should be no error messages displayed. Environment Variables Since the bot depends on a lot of API's and secrets to do all the tracking features for music, osu! gameplay, etc, there are quite a few environment variables to consider. Heres a snapshot of them. SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=.. SLACK_APP_TOKEN=.. LEETCODE_HANDLE=. SLACK_USER_ID=.. SLACK_CHANNEL_IDS=.. LASTFM_USER=.. LASTFM_API_KEY=.. CLIENT_SECRET=.. CLIENT_ID=.. OSU_ID=.. OSU_V1_API=.. BLACKLISTED_CHANNEL_IDS=.. ROAST_CHANNEL_ID=.. If you fill out these environment variables from the websites in the readme, your bot will work. Commands Yapper is a Bot meaning it doesn't have its own commands, rather we assume that each action the bot carries out is a command. Join When a user joins the channel that Yapper is currently in it sends a message pinging the user, below is the message: Hi @<user>, welcome to the land where @<owner> writes shit code You can change this message by going to events/joined.py and changing the string to your liking. Leave If you want the bot to leave the channel, its quite simple, by using /yapperLeave (and making sure its setup in your Slack API), the bot will leave the channel the command was used in. Here is the message it displays: Leaving #<channel name> now. Bye! If you want to modify this message, head over to your events/leave.py file and changing the leave string as you want.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-yapper-slack-bot-documentation","text":"","title":"Welcome to the Yapper Slack Bot Documentation"},{"location":"#table-of-contents","text":"Requirements Installation Environment Variables First Time Setup Commads","title":"Table of Contents"},{"location":"#requirements","text":"The requirements for the Yapper bot are pretty simple.

I was inspired by another Hack Clubbers bot names Zeon that tracks everything from Crypto transactions to daily logs. It was basically their own companion bot that made the server more alive. I wanted my bot to have 1 main function: Track literally everything I do and display to everyone in my slack channel. A little invasive? Yes. But also very hilarious","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-the-yapper-slack-bot","text":"The reason I started developing Yapper was due to my personal channel (a channel made and managed by you) in the Hack Club Slack being kind of dead.
